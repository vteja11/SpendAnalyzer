## Assumptions
```
1. The Input File is Valid, i.e it has All the four required columns and amount is a number
```

## Limitations
```
1. The maximum aggregation possible is 1.7 x 10^308, i.e the total sum of the amount spent for a vendor should be less than 
   the given maximum. If the sum exceeds the given maximum, 'âˆž' is shown in the report 
```

## Trouble Shooting 
```
1. Make sure java is properly installed by typing "java -version" in console 
2. Make sure JAVA_HOME is set to same jdk version as java 
3. Make sure maven is installed properly by typing "mvn -v"
4. If you have problems with maven try to download binary archives rather than source archives 
5. This project is tested in both Windows OS and Linux OS. If OS related problems occur please search online
